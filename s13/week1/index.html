		<h2>About the Course</h2>
		
		<p>Core Lab: Interaction is about creating user interfaces, and understanding how they work. The main focus will be on making things for the web. We will learn and practice the fundamentals of how to write HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to produce usable and engaging interfaces. To that end, we will be exploring typography, multi-column layouts, navigation menus, image galleries, and more!</p>
		
		<p>This course is designed to be complementary to Core Studio: Interaction (you should be enrolled in the studio with the same section as this course, section D, taught by Irwin Chen). The emphasis here will be placed on learning the technical things you’ll need in order to explore the concepts you’ll be learning in your studio class.</p>
