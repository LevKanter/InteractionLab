				<h1><div>A Long Way</div> from The Stuffed Cabbage</h1>
				<h2>by Haruki Murakami</h2>
			</div>
			
			<div class="story-main">
				<p><span class="drop-cap">S</span>ometimes I meet a person who says <q><span>&ldquo;</span>I've had so many interesting experiences that I can write lots of books about them.<span>&rdquo;</span></q> I think I've head quite a few people say the same thing especially since I came here. This doesn't mean that Americans say such a thing, but that many Japanese living in America often do. What they say might be probably true, because it's quite challenging to live away from their home country, and they must have encountered various kinds of exciting happenings in this country. It's quite natural that they should have a strong wish to tell their story to someone else.</p>
				<p>Of course, I don't know if they are really going to write their own novels someday. But I can only say this after all; despite the background as a writer who has written quite a number of novels so far, I've almost never had any <q>truly exciting</q> incidents in my private life. No doubt I might have had something exciting as a person living more than 40 years, such as meeting a strange and myterious person or being greatly shocked by a sudden change of destiny. Some memory, I can't tell you what it is though, makes me smile and some still makes me so sore. Thrilling things once quivered me with excitement. Nevertheless I guess you must also have gone through such things as I have experienced in my life. I've never met anyone who can be said to have experienced <q>such an unbelievable happening as no one ever had even in this large world.</q> If I were quite a stranger to writing novels and asked if I can declare to people that <q>I've got so much stock of interesting topics for my writing,</q> then my answer to this question will be <q>No.</q> What I could do is just confess honestly that <q>My life was somewhat interesting in its way, but not interesting enough to write a novel about it.</q></p>

			<h1>In Another Country</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>A man spreads ouy dried fruit</li>
				<li>on an old blanket and lets the flies</li>
				<li>descend in a frenzy. When I try to shoo</li>
				<li>them away he squats down to eye level,</li>
				<li>takes my right hand delicately in his,</li>
				<li>shakes his head, and mumbles</li>
				<li>what might be a prayer or words</li>
				<li>of advice or a curse. I don't know</li>
				<li>because no one here&mdash;neither the sellers</li>
				<li>nor the buyers&mdash;speaks a language</li>
				<li>I understand. An old grandfather</li>
				<li>whose white hair halos his head</li>
				<li>sits cross-legged on the damp grass</li>
				<li>smoking his pipe, his eyes closed.</li>
				<li>His wares: a pyramid of stained teeth.</li>
				<li>Shall I assume he is the dentist</li>
				<li>of the town? There is no town, only</li>
				<li>fields of long grass blowing in the wind</li>
				<li>and beyond the wind the gray mountains.</li>
				<li>A young woman, her forehead</li>
				<li>and cheeks a web of delicate tattoos,</li>
				<li>holds out a bowl of red powder.</li>
				<li>Her eyes are so alive I have to</li>
				<li>look away. She licks a forefinger,</li>
				<li>then jabs it into the powder and offers</li>
				<li>me a taste. Blue and white pennants</li>
				<li>fly from the tent poles. Women and children</li>
				<li>on muleback stream down from the hills</li>
				<li>or from nowhere. The powder tastes</li>
				<li>like nothing I know, not bitter like</li>
				<li>orange rind nor sweet like ground</li>
				<li>rose petals nor bland like dyed flour.</li>
				<li>I had heard there were storks nesting</li>
				<li>on the haystacks and on the tallest</li>
				<li>chimnets of the remote villages,</li>
				<li>and that wild, black-winged falcons</li>
				<li>circled the fields all day keeping</li>
				<li>watch over the land, feeding on whatever</li>
				<li>came to rest. I saw none of that;</li>
				<li>the only birds were tiny and caged,</li>
				<li>beating their wings against the bars,</li>
				<li>chattering like distant voices in dreams.</li>
				<li>I've forgotten how I got there. I know</li>
				<li>I knelt to a cold stream to wash my face</li>
				<li>and wakened to music, an odd beat,</li>
				<li>a melody I'd heard before. I followed</li>
				<li>the sound over a rise to the open field</li>
				<li>where the sun poured down its grace</li>
				<li>on the long grass, the animals, the men</li>
				<li>and women. The wind kept prodding</li>
				<li>at my back as though determined</li>
				<li>to push me away from where I was,</li>
				<li>fearful, perhaps, I would come to rest.</li>
