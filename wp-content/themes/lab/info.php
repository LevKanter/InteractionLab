					<h3>Course Description</h3>
				
					<p><em>Interaction: Core Lab</em> is about creating user interfaces, and understanding how they work. Special focus will be on making things for the web. We will learn how to write HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to produce usable and engaging interfaces. To that end, we will be exploring typography, multi-column layouts, navigation menus, image galleries, and more!</p>
				
					<p>If you have never written or seen HTML, fear not! We will concentrate on the basics. Everything is going to be okay! If it happens that you already do have experience with these technologies, fear not, you won’t bored&mdash; we will hone your craft.</p>
				
					<h3>Class Website</h3>
				
					<p>I will be using this website to post homework assignments, any other class info and administrative stuff, resources, tutorials, examples, etc. I encourage you to use this site throughout the semester.</p>
				
					<h3>Schedule</h3>
				
					<p>Please refer to the <a href="#sched">Schedule</a> section of this page for a tentative schedule of class topics. The schedule may be adapted and tweaked as the semester progresses, and what’s on the site will always be kept up to date accordingly.</p>
				
					<h3>Student Expectations</h3>
				
					<p>You will be getting homework, generally on a weekly basis (that is typically due the following week). Because everyone in this class is also taking <em>Interaction: Core Studio</em>, emphasis will be placed on learning the technical things you’ll need in order to execute your studio projects. This means that at some points during the semester, we will be workshopping your core studio projects in this class. So, of course, you are expected to be up to date with your work in Core Studio as well.</p>
				
					<p>You will also be required to keep a website for this class, where you will post links to your completed homework assignments. We will discuss the details of this in the first week.</p>
				
					<p>There is no physical textbook for this course. However, note that we will be looking at websites not only for inspiration, but also to analyze how they are structured.</p>
				
					<p>We will be using various software tools to accomplish things in this class. Everything we’ll need to use is completely free, and available in computer labs on campus. Please check the <a href="<?php bloginfo("url"); ?>/resources">Resources</a> page on the class website for details about what we will be using.</p>
				
					<p>Since we will at times be practicing and working on things in class, you are welcome to bring a laptop to work on, but note that it will be totally fine to use the computers in the classroom.</p>
				
					<h3>Grading</h3>
				
					<p>Your final grade will be based on the level of work you put into your homework, your website that you keep for this class, as well as how hard you work in class, and attendance.</p>
				
					<dl>
						<dt>Homework</dt>
						<dd>50%</dd>
					
						<dt>Website</dt>
						<dd>20%</dd>
					
						<dt>In-class work</dt>
						<dd>20%</dd>
					
						<dt>Attendance</dt>
						<dd>10%</dd>
					</dl>
				
					<h3>Attendance</h3>
				
					<p>Attendance is important. If you are absent more than <em>three</em> times, you will be at risk of failing this course.</p>
				
					<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
				
					<p>Plagiarism and cheating is bad (e.g. not cool). The assignments given in this class will generally be exercises that involve writing HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and for all of these technologies it’s very easy to look up solutions on the internet, and copy somebody else’s code wholesale. You won’t learn a single thing by doing this.</p>
				
					<p>That said, we <em>will</em> be leveraging open source frameworks and libraries to build things in this class. It’s not only okay, but in fact you are encouraged, to use example code that you find (or that I provide) and incorporate it in your work. When you do this, have a basic understanding of why you are using a certain piece of code, and always give credit where it’s due.</p>
				
					<h3>Student Disability Services</h3>
				
					<p>In keeping with the University’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to meet with Jason Luchs in the office of Student Disability Services, who will conduct an intake, and if appropriate, provide an academic accommodation notification letter to you to bring to me. At that point I will review the letter with you and discuss these accommodations in relation to this course. Mr. Luchs’ office is located in 79 Fifth Avenue, 5th floor. His direct line is (212) 229-5626 x3135. You may also access more information through the University’s <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/studentservices/disability">web site</a>.</p>
