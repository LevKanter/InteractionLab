BONUS STUFF!!
These very weird-looking "selectors" are used to control
how text is styled when it is selected/highlighted (i.e. by clicking and
dragging over it with the mouse). To add to the weirdness, you need to use
both "::-moz-selection" and "::selection", because Firefox will only recognize
"::-moz-selection", whereas other browser, such as Chrome and Safari, will
only recognize "::selection".
The use of so-called "vendor-specific" selectors is an unfortunate evil
in writing CSS these days.
