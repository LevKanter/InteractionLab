		Responding to User Events. Introducing javascript, by way of jQuery, "selecting" elements and "binding" events to them. Manipulating attributes (addClass, removeClass).

		Create a basic tabbed navigation component. To do this, first setup a list of anchor links representing the "tabs", then setup a set of corresponding content containers (i.e. divs). Give each content container a unique "id" attribute, and then associate each tab with its corresponding content by setting its "href" attribute. Using jQuery, bind a click event to each tab. The click event handler should find the tab's corresponding content and show it, and also be sure to hide all the other content containers (i.e. the "siblings").
