			We provide multiple different encodings of our video,
			because not every browser can play the same video formats.
			
			Browsers will use the first source file that it supports.
			There is no single format that just works across the board.
			The common web-video-encodings are mp4, webm, and ogg (sometimes
			ogg is referred to as Theora).
			Tools like Miro (http://www.mirovideoconverter.com/) can be used
			to convert one video to various other encodings.

			We can nest regular HTML elements inside the <video>,
			but they will only be rendered by browsers that don't recognize/support
			<video>. This allows us to apply fallback content for people.
