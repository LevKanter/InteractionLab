							<h2>Week 1</h2>
							<div class="tier">
								<div class="column x6">
									<p>I highly recommend watching the introductory video series, <a href="http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com" target="_blank">Don't Fear the Internet</a>. It consists of six short videos, which should be watched in order (No. 1 is towards the bottom of the page).</p>
									<p>For homework, please create an HTML page that will evolve into the place where you keep links to your work throughout the semester (i.e. your website for this class). This week, it should start out simple. Your page should, at the very least, display a title (e.g. "My Lab Page"), a short paragraph of text about yourself (or about anything you want), and an image. You should also use a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element to associate a .css stylesheet with your HTML document (use a <em>relative</em> path!). Don't worry about controlling layout or anything fancy right now, but experiment with manipulating the colors and typography of your HTML elements. This week is really just about getting your feet wet with this stuff. Definitely email me with any questions, etc.</p>

									<p>There seem to be a handful of problems with uploading files to the Newschool webspace server (I've had trouble with this server in the past, unfortunately). In the first class I'd asked you to work on using <a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/" target="_blank">Fugu</a> or another SFTP program to connect to your space on the Newschool server. Let's actually hold off with that for this week. If you've already been able to connect to and upload stuff to your webspace, great! If not, don't worry about that for now. I'm working on getting you all easier-to-work-with server spaces by next week. Eventually, everyone will still have to upload their files. but for now please work on your files locally and bring them to class next week. Note that we will now be meeting in 55 W 13th Street, Room 405 (which has computers).</p>

								<h3>Course Description</h3>
								<p><em>Core Lab: Interaction</em> is about creating user interfaces, and understanding how they work. The main focus will be on making things for the web. We will learn how to write HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to produce usable and engaging interfaces. To that end, we will be exploring typography, multi-column layouts, navigation menus, image galleries, and more!</p>
								<p>This course is designed to be complementary to <em>Core Studio: Interaction</em>. The emphasis here will be placed on learning the technical things you’ll need in order to explore the concepts taught in your studio class.</p>
								<p>If you have never written or seen HTML, fear not! We will concentrate on the basics. Everything is going to be okay! If it happens that you already do have experience with these technologies, fear not, you won’t bored– we will hone your craft. At the end of the day, my goal here is for you to be able to produce work in the interactive realm that you are proud of.</p>

								<h3>Class Website</h3>
								<p>I will be using a website to post homework assignments, class info and administrative- type stuff, resources, tutorials, notes, examples, etc. The url for the site is: <a href="http://interactionlab.info">http://interactionlab.info</a>. You should check there throughout the semester.</p>

								<h3>Schedule</h3>
								<p>There will be a running schedule of class topics and assignments, accessible on the class website. I may adapt and adjust the schedule as the semester progresses, but will keep what’s on the site up to date accordingly.</p>

								<h3>Student Expectations</h3>
								<p>You will be getting homework every week that is usually due by the following class. There will be two larger assignments for which you will have more time (2–3 weeks).</p>
								<p>There will be an in-class midterm quiz. Details about this will come in advance.</p>
								<p>You are required to keep a website for this class, where you will post links to your completed homework assignments. We will discuss the details of this in the first week.</p>
								<p>We will practice and work on things a good amount during class. You are welcome to bring a laptop to work on, but note that it will be fine to use the computers in the classroom. Details about the software tools we’ll actually be using will be discussed in depth, but everything you’ll need is completely free and available in computer labs on campus.</p>
								<p>There is a lot of software out there, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, that enables one to produce websites through a visual interface, rather than by writing any code. In order to gain an understanding of how things really work under the hood, you will be required to write the code using a text editor.</p>
								<p>The material we are covering in this course can be tough to learn. It’s challenging to write code that doesn’t have errors, and one small error can cause an entire project to break. It takes practice and patience to get into a groove with this stuff, but if you stick to it I think you’ll find that you can make a lot of cool stuff with code that doesn’t have to be extremely complicated.</p>

								<h3>Grading</h3>
								<p>Your final grade will be based on the quality and execution of your homework assignments, the website that you keep for this class, your midterm quiz, how hard you work in class, and attendance.</p>

								</dl>

								<h3>Attendance</h3>
								<p>Attendance is important. If you are absent more than three times, you will be at risk of failing this course.</p>

								<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
								<p>Plagiarism and cheating is bad.</p>
								<p>The assignments given in this class will generally be exercises that involve writing HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and for these technologies it’s easy to look up solutions on the internet, and copy somebody else’s code wholesale. You won’t learn anything by doing this.</p>
								<p>That said, we may be leveraging open source frameworks and libraries to build things in this class. It’s totally okay to incorporate example code that you find (or that I provide) in your work. But if you do this, have a basic understanding of why you are using a certain piece of code, and always give credit where it’s due.</p>

								<h3>Student Disability Services</h3>
								<p>In keeping with the University’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to meet with Jason Luchs in the office of Student Disability Services, who will conduct an intake, and if appropriate, provide an academic accommodation notification letter to you to bring to me. At that point I will review the letter with you and discuss these accommodations in relation to this course. Mr. Luchs’ office is located in 79 Fifth Avenue, 5th floor. His direct line is (212) 229-5626 x3135. You may also access more information through the <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/studentservices/disability">University’s web site</a>.</p>
