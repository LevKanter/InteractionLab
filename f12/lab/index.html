									<h3>Assignment</h3>

									<p>In the <a href="from_class/lab_week10.zip">files from class</a>, the example I called <em>navigation</em> (containing just a navigation.html file) is just what we got started in class, and not at all complete. We will use it in class on Tuesday and, using both CSS and Javascript, end up making it into an image slideshow.</p>

									<p>This week, please begin by making a copy of the <em>navigation.html</em> file. Find at least 5 images that you will eventually use for your slideshow. The images can be whatever you want, but they should be prepared for web usage (i.e. RGB color, 72dpi, not ridiculously large, probably JPEG or PNG, etc). In your <em>navigation.html</em>, begin by replacing all the placeholder contents of each <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element with one of your images, so that you end up with one image per <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>. Eventually the links in the <em>table of contents</em> <code>.toc</code> list will be used to navigate through your slideshow, by showing one <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> at a time (and hiding all the rest).</p>

									<p>Create a new stylesheet and link it to your <em>navigation.html</em>. Provide CSS that hides all the <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements (i.e. using <code>display: none;</code>). Then, also provide a way to show any <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> that also has a given class (like we did with the <code>.demo-thing</code> in our addClass example). Without worrying yet about Javascript or jQuery, you can manually put that class on the first <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> element in your page. You should end up seeing just one of your images, with all the other ones hidden. Also take some time to visually style your page&mdash; color, typography, layout, and everything. Think about how you will want it to look once it becomes a functioning slideshow, where you want the navigation links to be in relation to the slideshow content, etc!</p>

									<p>Create a new javascript file and include it in your <em>navigation.html</em> as well (make sure to include <em>after</em> the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag that loads jQuery). Setup a function to be automatically executed once the <code>documemnt</code> is <em>ready</em> (confirm that this function is properly executed by having it log a message, such as "document is ready" to the <code>console</code>).</p>

									<p>That's as far you need to get this week. In addition to posting a link to this assignment on your class website, please bring your files to class on Tuesday&mdash; we will be using them.</p>

									<p>If you want to keep going, the next step will be to use jQuery to find all the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> elements in the <code>.toc</code> list. Associate a click event handler with those elements. The click event handler will be responsible for figuring out which <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> corresponds to the element that was clicked on (<em>hint, use jQuery's <a href="http://api.jquery.com/attr/" target="_blank">attr function</a> to read the href attribute of the element that was clicked on</em>), and subsequently adding the class to it that causes it to become visible. The click event handler will also need to remove that class from any of the other sections.</p>

							<h2>Week 10</h2>
							<div class="tier">
								<div class="column x7">

									<p>This week, please review the <a href="from_class/lab_week10.zip">files from class</a>. I've an include the example of embedding a video into a page using the <code><a href="http://html5doctor.com/the-video-element/" target="_blank">&lt;video&gt;</a></code> element, as well as the introductory Javascript and jQuery stuff we worked on. We'll pick up where we left off next week.</p>

									<h3>Assignent</h3>

									<p>I'd like you to also read and work through both the JavaScript Basics and jQuery Basics chapters of the tutorial <a href='http://jqfundamentals.com/' target='_blank'>jQuery Fundamentals</a> (this will review some things I've introduced).</p>

									<p>In the jQuery intro that we started in class, you'll find I've added a little more. In adddition to the <em>click-me</em> element that we had, there's now an article of dummy text in the page, which has a class of <em>main-text</em>. This element is not visible when you first load the page because it has a <code>display: none</code> property in the CSS. But when you click on the the thing that says <em>Click me!</em> you should see the main text fade in. Try to follow the code to see how I did this in the <code>handleLinkClick</code> function that's defined.</p>

									<p>Please make a new HTML document with a top-level heading of "jQuery 101". Just like our example from class, your page should have at least two elements: something prompting the user to click on it (such as a button), and another element (such as an image, a block of text, or anything) that somehow visually changes when your first element is clicked. This code will be quite similar to what's in my demo, but I challenge you to figure out how to use jQuery to <a href='http://docs.jquery.com/Attributes/addClass' target='_blank'>dynamically add a class</a> to some HTML element. If your CSS defines some properties specific to that class, than adding it to the element on the fly is all that's needed to visually change it! Feel free to email me for help if you get stuck. As always, upload this exercise and add a link to it on your class site!</p>

									<h3>Re: Final Projects</h3>

									<p>I mentioned in class that your final project for this class will be to make yourself a portfolio website. We will discuss the criteria in more detail soon, I just wanted to give you a heads up in case you want to already get going with it.</p>

									<p>If you don't want to do the portfolio site, you were welcome to propose something else, just let me know before you start working on it, so we can discuss.</p>

							<h2>Week 8</h2>
							<div class="tier">
								<div class="column x7">

									<p>Please thoroughly review <a href='from_class/lab_week7.zip'>the code I posted last week</a> that demonstrated setting up a horizontal dropdown. Pay special attention to the usage of the <code>&gt;</code> symbol in some of the CSS selectors, and the usage of <code>top: 100%</code> and <code>left: 100%</code> to control the offsets of the absolutely positioned menus. Pop the HTML file into Chrome and use the Inspector to experiment with changing the values around!</p>

									<p>Beyond that, I'm not going to require any new assignment this week. If you're missing homework, take this time to get fully caught up.</p>

									<p>As an optional assignment, rework your class website to incorporate a dropdown list of all the links to your homeworks. Have an element labeled <em>Homework</em> that reveals the list of homeworks when you hover over it (and make it look awesome!).</p>

									<h3>Alternate Quiz</h3>

									<p>If you missed last week's quiz, please complete <a href='lab_quiz_alt.zip'>the alternate version</a> this week and link to your solution on your site. The task is exactly the same as the original quiz, but the design for you to match is different.</p>

									<p>The two font families used in this design are Georgia and Courier New. Don't forget to play with the <code>line-height</code> property to get the spacing between the lines of text to match the design.</p>

									<p>If you took the in-class quiz, you don't have to do this one. You're welcome to, however, if you aren't happy with what you originally did.</p>

									<h3>Note About Javascript</h3>

									<p>We're going to be delving into some Javascript soon. I introduced it (in a rather rushed and sloppy way) towards the end class today. <em>I don't want you to worry about it this week</em>, because I want to get into it properly starting next week. Javascript is going to be our primary tool for manipulating elements in our HTML, in response to user-initiated events like clicking on something or typing into the keyboard. To make these things a little bit easier to do than they would be if we have to write all the code from scratch, we'll be using a Javascript library, <a href='http://jquery.com/' target='_blank'>jQuery</a>. jQuery is essentially a collection of already-written Javascript that defines some useful functions that we'll leverage. Again, don't worry if this all seems crazy right now&hellip; but just in case you want to get a head start, I recommend peeking at the first chapter of the online textbook, <a href='http://jqfundamentals.com/' target='_blank'>jQuery Fundamentals</a>.</p>

If you do so, please do not overwrite what you uploaded at the end of the actual quiz today. Rather, inculde a seperate link on your site to your second version.</p>

									<p>Today in class we started making a horizontal dropdown menu by nesting list elements inside one another. We obviously didn't have time to finish the lesson (we will go back over this and finish next week) &mdash; but in the <a href="from_class/lab_week7.zip">files from class</a> download I've provided complete code and comments for the finished dropdown, in case you want to see where it was all headed. Note the use of both relative and absolute positioning to control the layout of the sub-menus. Just for fun and the sake of review, I also incorporated CSS transitions and drop shadows into the demo!</p>

									<p>The <a href="lab_quiz.zip">Quiz Files .zip</a> has everything you need for this quiz.</p>

									<p>Your task is to reproduce, as close as you can, the image (quiz.png) as an HTML document, using a text editor. You may use the Chrome Inspector, and you may use an online reference like <a href="http://dochub.io/#css/" target="_blank">DocHub</a> to look up CSS properties, etc. Feel free to use Photoshop or similar tools to determine margin/padding measurements, font sizes, etc. An HTML file (quiz.html) and stylesheet (quiz_style.css) have been started for you. The stylesheet has a .clearfix class already defined. Use the file raw_text.txt to get any of the text, and what’s included in the images folder to get any of the images used in the page. You have one hour and a half. By the end of this time, you should submit your quiz by uploading it to your server space and linking to it from your class site. If for some reason you are not able to do this, you may still email me a zip of your files (but you will lose points for that).</p>

								<div class="column x7">

									<h3>Quiz Next Week</h3>

									<p>Next week, there will be a quiz in class. I will give you an image of a simple web page, and you have to reproduce it &mdash; as close as you can &mdash; using HTML and CSS in a text editor. I'll also provide you with a base HTML file and a base CSS file that has .clearfix defined in it, just in case you need to use it. Any text and images you’ll need will be provided as well (so you can just copy and paste paragraphs of text into your HTML, etc). You will have an hour and a half to complete this.</p>

									<p>The quiz will cover HTML and CSS from the first five weeks of the semester. Make sure you understand the following:</p>

									<ul class='bullet-list'>
										<li>Working with various header elements, paragraphs, lists, <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags, and hyperlinks (the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag).</li>

										<li>Including an image in the HTML content using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag.</li>

										<li>Margins, padding, and borders.Centering a container (such as a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>) on the page using "auto" margins.</li>

										<li>Making two block-elements sit side by side using the float property.</li>

										<li>.clearfix</li>

										<li>Applying a tiled background image to an element using the background-image and background-repeat property.</li>
									</ul>

									<p>To submit your quiz in class, you will have to upload the files to your webspace and put a link to it on your index site (the same site where you've been adding links to your individual homeworks).</p>

									<p>There might also be an extra-credit component that involves absolute positioning. Please email me if you have any questions, need help, etc!</p>

									<h3>Map Project (due 10/24 &mdash; not next week)</h3>

									<p>Please design and build a visualizaton that consists of overlaying various content above specific points on a map. This stems from the maps+flags exercise we did in class, except what you're going to make should be way more fleshed-out and <em>awesome</em> than just putting flags on top of countries. You must have a minimum of <em>three</em> different points on the map where content is overlayed (though I encourage you to have more).</p>

									<p>As long as you satisify the essential requirements I'm specifying for this assignment, the content and map that you develop is entirely up to you. You can use a map of the world, a country, a city, an architectural blueprint, a subway map, any kind of map you come up with. The content you choose to associate with your map is up to you as well. You can overlay images, text, video (we'll learn that in class next week!), a combination of different things, etc. It can be serious, funny, informative, whacky, anything! Make something that's genuinely interesting to you. If you feel stuck, let me know and I'll try to help brainstorm ideas. Your project doesn't need to be crazy complex or fancy. It can be simple, but it should be compelling, aesthetically pleasing, and well-executed.</p>

									<p>The page you make should be an overall cohesive interface. If somebody not in this class were to land on it, they should be able to understand what it is (i.e. what your map and content are showing). So think about other elements besides just the map itself, such as a title, overview text, etc. Everything should be on one HTML page.</p>

									<p>You are responsible for gathering and preparing the images or any other assets that you need. I recommend searching the web for high quality images that are in the public domain (i.e. not copyrighted). For maps, large vector (.eps) files can be particularly useful because you can open them in Illustrator or Photoshop and scale and crop them however you like. Do a search for 'public domain maps .eps' and you'll see how easy it is to find stuff. Ultimately, all media assets should be local in your project. This means, if you find an image online that you want to use, you have to download it and pull it into your HTML/CSS using relative paths, rather than linking directly to its original URL!</p>

									<p>Use relative/absolute positioning to layer things above your map. Remember to pay attention to what happens to the positioning of your elements when the size of the browser window changes, as you may not want the layout of your overlays to shift around.</p>

							<h2>Week 5</h2>
							<div class="tier">
								<div class="column x7">

									<h3>Assignment</h3>

									<p>This week, please begin by devising your own CSS grid system, in a similar vein as what we did in class (we did two different versions. It may be easiest to start by figuring out how many columns you want to fit, and how wide you want your outermost container to be. The dimensions of your grid are up to you, but they should be different than the particular dimensions we used in class. The number of columns is also up to you, but please accommodate at least 8 columns (grid-based layouts in websites tend to consist of somewhere between 8 and 16 columns &mdash; we had 10 columns for both grids we did in class). Provide classes in your CSS to define the width for each multiple of columns, like we did with ".x1", ".x2", ".x3", and so on. (While of course these classes can be named however you want &mdash; I used x1, x2, etc just to indicate that x1 represented the width of one column, x2 represented two-columns wide, etc etc). Feel free to use that same naming scheme in your grid system, but you're not required to if you want to come up with your own. Also think about how you might want to space your grid columns apart. In our first grid example we didn't have any margins and padding on our ".column" containers, but we created space by adding padding around the contents inside individual columns, whereas in the second variation we actually used margins on the columns themselves.</p>

									<p>Then, choose at least 5 images (these can be images of your work (i.e. your portfolio), a collection of photos, drawings, anything you want) and create a webpage that presents them in a grid-based layout, using your CSS system to group images into various columns.</p>

									<p>In addition to at least 5 images arranged into some column-based layout, your page should have a title header (i.e. "My Image Gallery" or whatever). Ultimately, your gallery shouldn't show the grid columns like in my example -- those are just there to illustrate how things are alligned with columns. However, <em>as a bonus</em> (not required), actually provide a way to see your grid columns in the background, by adding a class to the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> like we did with the WORK-IN-PROGRESS class.</p>

							<h2>Week 4</h2>
							<div class="tier">
								<div class="column x7">

									<h3>Assignment</h3>

									<p>Please take a look at the wireframe version of The Onion we started to produce in class.</p>

									<p>In the same vein, I'd like you to pick a different large site with a fixed-width, multi-column layout on its home page, and create your own, lo-res wireframe-esque replica of it. You can choose any site <em>other than The Onion</em> that fits that criteria, but some potential candidates are: <a href="http://bostonglobe.com" target="_blank">The Boston Globe</a>, <a href="http://rhizome.org" target="_blank">Rhizome.org</a>, <a href="http://nytimes.com" target="_blank">The New York Times</a>.</p>

									<p>Don't worry about interactive components, or even graphics and stylistic details. This is all just about breaking the page down into its core containers: the header, the footer, the various content columns, primary nav, secondary nav, and so on. Use dummy content (“lorem ipsum…”, placeholder images) to fill out the various containers. As much as you can, try to eliminate redundancy in your CSS by reusing classes for repetetive layout structures.</p>

									<p>Note that my The Onion example is not very far along at all, it is just showing some starting steps. Your wireframed site should still be lo-res, but take it further than I did with the Onion. Try to capture all the essential elements of the page.</p>

									<p><em>As a bonus:</em> please take a look through <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/pics/0703/grids_are_good.pdf" target="_blank">Grids are Good</a>, a presentation by <a href="http://subtraction.com">Khoi Vinh</a> and <a href="http:/markboulton.co.uk">Mark Boulton</a> about grid-based layouts and their role on the web!</p>

							<h2>Week 3</h2>
							<div class="tier">
								<div class="column x7">

									<h3>Assignment</h3>

									<p>This week, please begin by finding a short story or some sort of article of text online. It can be anything you want, with the exception of the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fiction/features/2012/08/06/120806fi_fiction_fitzgerald" target="_blank">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a> story I used in class. Some places to look are <a href="http://www.americanliterature.com/sstitleindex.html" target="_blank">this American literature site</a> or <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/" target="_blank">The New Yorker</a>. You don't have to use a story that is crazy long or anything, but it must bve at least 10 paragraphs (if the story is longer, you can just use the first 10 paragraphs of it).</p>

									<p>Once you have a short story, create a basic HTML version of it. Note that I want you to write the HTML yourself, so if you're taking a story from a website don't merely view the page source and copy the markup that's already there. Writing this much HTML is going to be a somewhat tedious exercise (this is actually probably the most you're going to have to write in one swoop all semester). Keep your markup <strong>as simple as possible</strong>, but pay attention to details such as text that should be <a href="http://html5doctor.com/element-index/#em" target="_blank">emphasized</a>, or text that should be in <a href="http://html5doctor.com/element-index/#q" target="_blank">quotes</a>.</p>

									<p>In addition to the actual content of each story, please provide headings for the story's title and the story's author.</p>

									<p>Also create a stylesheet for your story. Focus on styling the typography and controllng how things are spaced out (with margins, padding, etc). The only concrete requirements for you CSS is that you use a "web font" at least once &mdash; either with <code>@font-face</code> directly, or via a service such as <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts" target="_blank">Google Web Fonts</a> (remember back to Week 2) &mdash; and you use a <a href="http://dochub.io/#css/background-image" target="_blank"><code>background-image</code></a> at least once.</p>

							<h2>Week 2</h2>
							<div class="tier">
								<div class="column x7">
									<p>Please note, I've added a few comments to the files from class, as well <strong>as one new thing</strong>. You'll notice that the <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> element we were starting to work with in class now has a width and is horizontally centered in the page!</p>

									<h3>Assignment</h3>

									<p>In your site for this class, create a section with the heading <em>Homework</em> and an unordered list (<code>&lt;ul&gt;</code>). From now on, all your work should be uploaded to your webspace and linked to from this part of your site (i.e. a list item <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> per assignment).</p>


									<p>Download the <a href="lab_bill_of_rights.zip">Bill of Rights Files</a>. You will find a raw, plain version of the Bill of Rights text for reference, a .html file with the "marked up" version we <del>rushed through</del> <ins>produced</ins> in class, and an empty .css file. This week, please write your own stylesheet for the Bill of Rights &mdash; <strong>without</strong> changing the .html at all. Infuse your own visual flare into the page. Experiment with spacing out elements by manipulating their margins, paddings, etc. Think about how you might apply styles to the paragraphs that are in the preamble, versus the paragraphs that make up the ammendments themselves (HINT: <code>li p { }</code>). You're probably also going to want to play a lot with <a href="http://dochub.io/#css/list-style" target="_blank">list-style</a> properties. Get as fancy as you want, or keep it simple, but make it look dope!
When you upload/link to this on your site, upload both bill_of_rights.html and style.css (and of course, any other assets you have if you end up using font files or something), and have the link point to your bill_of_rights.html file.</p>


									<h3>Connecting to the new server space</h3>	
									<p>Just to recap, I've created a server space for each of you, that you can connect to using an FTP program, and upload your files to. Keep in mind that Fugu does not do FTP (only SFTP - which is similar but different). I recommend using <a href="http://cyberduck.ch/" target="_blank">Cyberduck</a>, which is free and available for Mac and Windows. The computers at school all have <a href="http://fetchsoftworks.com/">Fetch</a>. Fetch is very similar to Cyberduck (really most FTP programs are analagous).</p>
									<p>Each of you can view your space on the internet by going to <code>interactionlab.info/students/[your newschool username]</code>.</p>
									<p>To connect to your space, you need to specify the server to be <code>levkanter.com</code>, and your username will be <code>[your newschool username]@levkanter.com</code>. Your password is just your newschool ID, starting with the capital letter N.</p>
									<p><img src="images/server_connect_cyberduck.png" alt="Cyber screenshot"></p>
									<p>There is no <code>public_html</code> folder. What you upload in the directory where you land when you connect will be public. If anyone has trouble with this, please let me know.</p>

							<h2>Week 1</h2>
							<div class="tier">
								<div class="column x7">
									<p>I highly recommend watching the introductory video series, <a href="http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com" target="_blank">Don't Fear the Internet</a>. It consists of six short videos, which should be watched in order (No. 1 is towards the bottom of the page).</p>
									<p>For homework, please create an HTML page that will evolve into the place where you keep links to your work throughout the semester (i.e. your website for this class). This week, it should start out simple. Your page should, at the very least, display a title (e.g. "My Lab Page"), a short paragraph of text about yourself (or about anything you want), and an image. You should also use a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> element to associate a .css stylesheet with your HTML document (use a <em>relative</em> path!). Don't worry about controlling layout or anything fancy right now, but experiment with manipulating the colors and typography of your HTML elements. This week is really just about getting your feet wet with this stuff. Definitely email me with any questions, etc.</p>

									<p>There seem to be a handful of problems with uploading files to the Newschool webspace server (I've had trouble with this server in the past, unfortunately). In the first class I'd asked you to work on using <a href="http://rsug.itd.umich.edu/software/fugu/" target="_blank">Fugu</a> or another SFTP program to connect to your space on the Newschool server. Let's actually hold off with that for this week. If you've already been able to connect to and upload stuff to your webspace, great! If not, don't worry about that for now. I'm working on getting you all easier-to-work-with server spaces by next week. Eventually, everyone will still have to upload their files. but for now please work on your files locally and bring them to class next week. Note that we will now be meeting in 55 W 13th Street, Room 405 (which has computers).</p>

								Syllabus

							</h2>
							<div class="x8">
								<h3>Course Description</h3>
								<p><em>Core Lab: Interaction</em> is about creating user interfaces, and understanding how they work. The main focus will be on making things for the web. We will learn how to write HTML, CSS, and Javascript in order to produce usable and engaging interfaces. To that end, we will be exploring typography, multi-column layouts, navigation menus, image galleries, and more!</p>
								<p>This course is designed to be complementary to <em>Core Studio: Interaction</em>. The emphasis here will be placed on learning the technical things you’ll need in order to explore the concepts taught in your studio class.</p>
								<p>If you have never written or seen HTML, fear not! We will concentrate on the basics. Everything is going to be okay! If it happens that you already do have experience with these technologies, fear not, you won’t bored– we will hone your craft. At the end of the day, my goal here is for you to be able to produce work in the interactive realm that you are proud of.</p>

								<h3>Class Website</h3>
								<p>I will be using a website to post homework assignments, class info and administrative- type stuff, resources, tutorials, notes, examples, etc. The url for the site is: <a href="http://interactionlab.info">http://interactionlab.info</a>. You should check there throughout the semester.</p>

								<h3>Schedule</h3>
								<p>There will be a running schedule of class topics and assignments, accessible on the class website. I may adapt and adjust the schedule as the semester progresses, but will keep what’s on the site up to date accordingly.</p>

								<h3>Student Expectations</h3>
								<p>You will be getting homework every week that is usually due by the following class. There will be two larger assignments for which you will have more time (2–3 weeks).</p>
								<p>There will be an in-class midterm quiz. Details about this will come in advance.</p>
								<p>You are required to keep a website for this class, where you will post links to your completed homework assignments. We will discuss the details of this in the first week.</p>
								<p>We will practice and work on things a good amount during class. You are welcome to bring a laptop to work on, but note that it will be fine to use the computers in the classroom. Details about the software tools we’ll actually be using will be discussed in depth, but everything you’ll need is completely free and available in computer labs on campus.</p>
								<p>There is a lot of software out there, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, that enables one to produce websites through a visual interface, rather than by writing any code. In order to gain an understanding of how things really work under the hood, you will be required to write the code using a text editor.</p>
								<p>The material we are covering in this course can be tough to learn. It’s challenging to write code that doesn’t have errors, and one small error can cause an entire project to break. It takes practice and patience to get into a groove with this stuff, but if you stick to it I think you’ll find that you can make a lot of cool stuff with code that doesn’t have to be extremely complicated.</p>

								<h3>Grading</h3>
								<p>Your final grade will be based on the quality and execution of your homework assignments, the website that you keep for this class, your midterm quiz, how hard you work in class, and attendance.</p>

								<h3>Attendance</h3>
								<p>Attendance is important. If you are absent more than three times, you will be at risk of failing this course.</p>

								<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
								<p>Plagiarism and cheating is bad.</p>
								<p>The assignments given in this class will generally be exercises that involve writing HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and for these technologies it’s easy to look up solutions on the internet, and copy somebody else’s code wholesale. You won’t learn anything by doing this.</p>
								<p>That said, we may be leveraging open source frameworks and libraries to build things in this class. It’s totally okay to incorporate example code that you find (or that I provide) in your work. But if you do this, have a basic understanding of why you are using a certain piece of code, and always give credit where it’s due.</p>

								<h3>Student Disability Services</h3>
								<p>In keeping with the University’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately. All conversations will be kept confidential. Students requesting any accommodations will also need to meet with Jason Luchs in the office of Student Disability Services, who will conduct an intake, and if appropriate, provide an academic accommodation notification letter to you to bring to me. At that point I will review the letter with you and discuss these accommodations in relation to this course. Mr. Luchs’ office is located in 79 Fifth Avenue, 5th floor. His direct line is (212) 229-5626 x3135. You may also access more information through the <a href="http://www.newschool.edu/studentservices/disability">University’s web site</a>.</p>
